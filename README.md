# Goat Collector

Basic outline for doing a fetch with options. Help Dane collect all his goats!

This is designed to be a resource to consolidate and practice JS fetches, I recommend digging through the code and if it doesn't make a ton of sense clone it down, add console.logs and change things up! 

Here is a shameless plug for my blog I wrote back when I was a student in Flatiron for a basic overview of fetches with options as well!
